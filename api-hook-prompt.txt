So now I want to improve my detector.py. Before actively monitor folder and detect encrypted file, I want to make old-school malware way: hook all suspicious dll and try to detect if dll call suspicious api for: encrypting files, spawn shellcode to load into memory (refer shellcode-loader.cpp). Suspicious activities must be logged using logging beside of detector logs, including download files from internet and above behavior. Create new file api-call-from-dll-detector.py and put helper function inside it. Continue priority to use tools in SysinternalSuite and needed-sysinternal then python library, and if you use any tools in SysinternalSuite folder, also move this exe into needed-sysinternal and call from this folder.
